# Booklet Print

## About

Python program to take a PDF and print it out as a "booklet".

NOTE: Currently the "print" bit is not done, so it just ouputs a re-ordered PDF.

## Why?

I have touble reading eBooks and eMagazines (is this a word?) I bought online on a laptop and my eReader got lost in a
fire (true story). So, I figure why not print out the books myself and read at my leisure (further justification

### Isn't this a bit backwards?

Look, I'll be honest... reading on my laptop I keep getting distracted by Facebook, email, Twitter and a whole host of
other apps vying for my attention. Ditto for trying to read anything longer than 10 minutes on my phone.

Also, my eReader screen was really small which annoyed me.

## Dependencies and how to run?

Needs Python 2 and the following extra modules:

* PyPDF
* argparse

Run with:

  ./reorder.py FILENAME.pdf
